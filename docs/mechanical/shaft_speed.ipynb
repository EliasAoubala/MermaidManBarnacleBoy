    "The shaft speed of turbopumps is an extremely influential parameter when it comes to the design to turbopump-driven cycles, as often it will drive the expected cycle performances of the system, coupled with being the key-contributor to the expected stresses the mechanical assembly will see.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before discussing in detail the impacts of shaft speed selection have on the overall subsystem, for the sake of brevity, **discussion will be limited to assemblies which have a single shaft, just like the intended architecture of the Mermaid-man turbopump assembly, along with gas-generator based engine cycles.**\n",
